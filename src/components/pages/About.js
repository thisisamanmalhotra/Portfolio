      <p>
        I'm Vivek, a 20 year old, Self-taught designer and coder from India.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 3rd year student current completing my Bachelors in Computer
        Science from SRM Institute Of Science and Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started learning coding when I came to college. I struggled through my
        1st semester and was introduced with the C programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found it very difficult to understand. Then one day I woke up and
        thought about starting from the basics. So I started with the HTML and
        CSS and then I moved on with JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started developing an interest in JavaScript and at that moment I got
        myself clear that I would like to continue my journey ahead with
        JavaScript. During this time I took a few courses and watched a
        countless number of YouTube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dream of creating my course someday to help others learn the modern
        trends in Computer Science and thinking of starting from the YouTube
        which is a great platform to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to cook and play Clash of Clans & PUBG in my free time (I am
        quiet good at them ðŸ˜œ).
      </p>
      <p>
        I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. Iâ€™m also a firm
        believer that we should never settle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m hard working, super curious, passionate, committed, and also a fast
        learner!
